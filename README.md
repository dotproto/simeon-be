# simeon-be
A terrible website I shouldn't actually make.

# What the hell is this?

On February 23, 2015 I registered the domain `simeon.be` with the plan of making stupid reaction gifs and listing them under various URLs. For example...

* `simeon.be/like/what`
* `simeon.be/all/pshh`
* `simeon.be/whateves`

# That's amazing, how can I help

You're a bad person and you should feel bad. Now go open a new issue and tell me what reactions and URLs you'd like to see.
